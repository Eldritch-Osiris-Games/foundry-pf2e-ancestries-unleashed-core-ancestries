            "description": "An ancestry feat with the exemplar trait represents ancestral abilities that are particularly powerful. A feat with this trait can be selected with a class feat or an ancestry feat. When using a class feat to select a feat with the exemplar trait, you select the feat in place of the class feat, meeting prerequisites as normal. When using an ancestry feat to select a feat with the exemplar trait, you must be at least twice the level of the feat. For example, you must be at least 12th level to select a 6th level feat with the exemplar trait as an ancestry feat."
